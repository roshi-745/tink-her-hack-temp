### Project Description
Safar is a solo-travel safety platform that performs periodic check-ins with users during their journey to ensure their well-being.
If a user feels unsafe or faces danger, they can instantly alert emergency contacts or nearby authorities by sharing their live location and identification details.
The system ensures travelers are continuously monitored so they never have to travel alone.

### The Problem statement
With the increasing number of individuals traveling alone for work, education, or leisure, ensuring personal safety during journeys has become a major concern. Solo travelers often lack a reliable system that can periodically check on their safety and quickly notify emergency contacts or authorities during unsafe situations. There is a need for a smart, user-controlled safety solution that provides continuous monitoring and instant emergency communication to enhance traveler security.

### The Solution
Safar addresses solo travel safety by providing a smart monitoring system where users can activate journey tracking for a selected time period. The platform performs periodic safety check-ins, prompting users to confirm their well-being. If the user feels unsafe or triggers a panic alert, the system immediately shares their live location and identification details with emergency contacts and nearby authorities, enabling faster response and assistance.
